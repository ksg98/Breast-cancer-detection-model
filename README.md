Breast cancer the most common cancer among women worldwide accounting for 25 percent of all cancer cases
and affected 2.1 million people in 2015 early diagnosis significantly increases the chances of survival.

The key challenge in cancer detection is how to classify tumors into malignant or benign machine learning
techniques can dramatically improves the accuracy of diagnosis.

We used the case study of Breast Cancer Detection with Reduced Feature Set
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271907638_Breast_Cancer_Detection_with_Reduced_Feature_Set

Research indicates that most experienced physicians can diagnose cancer with 79 percent accuracy while
91 percent correct diagnosis is achieved using machine learning techniques and we achieved 96% here.

In this case study our task is to classify tumors into malignant or benign tumors using features of
pain from several cell images.

Let's take a look at the cancer diagnosis and classification process.
So the first step in the cancer diagnosis process is to do what we call it final needle aspirate or
if any process which is simply extracting some of the cells out of the tumor.
And at that stage we don't know if that human is malignant or benign.
When you say malignant or benign as you guys can see these are kind of the images of the this would
be benign tumor and this is the malignant tumor.
And when we say benign that means that the tumor is kind of not spreading across the bodies of the patient
is safe somehow.

It's if it's malignant That means it's it's a cancerous.
That means we need to intervene and actually stop the cancer growth.

So what we do with that we extract out of these images some features when we see features that mean
some characteristics out of the image such as radius for example the cells such as texture perimeter
area smoothness and so on.

The idea is we want to teach the machine how to basically classify images or classify data and tell
us if it's malignant or benign for example in this case without any human intervention which is going
to change the model once the model is trained we're good to go we can use it in practice to classify
new images 

And that's kind of the overall procedure or the cancer diagnosis procedure.
